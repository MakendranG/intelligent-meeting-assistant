# 🎤 Speech Recognition Modes - Meeting Assistant

## 🎭 **Current Behavior Explained**

You're absolutely right! The application is currently running with **mock data** by default. This is intentional for demonstration purposes, but now you can switch to **real speech recognition**!

## 🔄 **Two Modes Available**

### **🎪 Demo Mode (Default)**
- ✅ **Simulated transcription** - generates fake speech every few seconds
- ✅ **Mock AI analysis** - creates sample action items and decisions
- ✅ **No real speech processing** - just visual feedback
- ✅ **Perfect for testing** - works without any API keys
- ✅ **Reliable demonstration** - always shows content

**Why Demo Mode?**
- Works immediately without setup
- Demonstrates all features reliably
- No dependency on internet or APIs
- Perfect for presentations and testing

### **🎤 Real Speech Mode (New!)**
- ✅ **Real browser speech recognition** - processes your actual voice
- ✅ **Live transcription** - converts your speech to text in real-time
- ✅ **Intelligent analysis** - detects real action items and decisions
- ✅ **Actual voice processing** - responds to what you actually say
- ✅ **Browser-based** - uses Chrome/Edge built-in speech recognition
